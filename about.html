      <p class="about-body">
        Hi,<a href="https://github.com/Mini-Sylar">Terence Quashie</a> here. This site was created as a way to easily
        search for all anime as well
        as receive recommendations. The primary goal of this project was to
        learn how to hit APIs and return some data, fortunately or
        unfortunately the source that was used had their API written using
        GraphQl <a href="" class="anilist">AniList</a> great site btw, so this
        was another great learning opportunity since most people use GraphQl
        anyway. I've written some websites using only vanilla javacript which
        you can check out <a href="" class="link-to-github">here</a> but this
        looks like the biggest one i've written...welp to more vanilla
        javacript projects 🥂
        <strike>Help me</strike>
