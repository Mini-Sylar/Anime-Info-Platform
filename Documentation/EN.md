### ANILIST GraphQL API
<hr>

In the index . js file a http get request with JS native fetch API is used to pull data from ANILIST.<br />
This is a look into how to get started using AniList's GraphQL API.<br />

### The FrontEnd Ties
<hr>

The Frontend is a simple combination of markup(html), styling(css) and data kicked in from the anilist API. There is a search section at the top section. There is a contact hyperlink and also an about hyperlink. The surprise me button gets random set of shows into the the cards of shows, the page's color theme also tries to match the overall color from the show.
<br />
<br />
Finally, for analytics, the page inject splitbee's analysis javascript source file into the html body.
